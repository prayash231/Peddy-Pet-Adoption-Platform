## Project Name: Peddy - Pet Adoption Platform

## Description: 

<b>Peddy</b> is a user-friendly pet adoption platform dedicated to connecting loving homes with pets in need. Whether you're looking to adopt or give a pet a second chance, Peddy simplifies the process, making it easy to find your perfect companion.

## 5 key features of this project:

- <u><b>View More Button:</b></u> When a user clicks on the View More button, the page will navigate  and will take to the "Adopt Your Best Friend" section, allowing the user to explore more options and information related to pet adoption. This section will provide additional details and features to enhance the user experience in finding their ideal pet.

- <u><b>Category Button:</b></u> In this project, there are four pet category buttons. When a user clicks on any one of the category buttons, for example, if the user clicks on the Rabbit button, all the data related to rabbits will be shown. But if no data is found after clicking the button, for example, if the user clicks on the Bird button but no data is currently available for birds, in that case, "No Information Available" will be displayed.

- <u><b>Sort By Price Button:</b></u> When a user clicks on the "Sort by Price" button, all the pet data will be displayed in descending order based on their price.

- <u><b>Like Button:</b></u> When a user clicks on the "like" button for a specific pet category,the image of that pet will be displayed in another container. Suppose a user likes a specific rabbit in the rabbit category. When they click the like button, only the image of that rabbit will be displayed in another container. And each time they click that like button, the image will continue to be appended.

- <u><b>Adopt Button:</b></u> When users click on the "Adopt" button for a specific pet category, a modal appears with a countdown, and it will take 3seconds. The modal also gives feedback that "the adoption process is started for your pet" which reassures users that their action has been registered. When the countdown ends, the modal will automatically close. At the same time, the inner text of the "Adopt" button will change to "Adopted," and the button will also be disabled.
